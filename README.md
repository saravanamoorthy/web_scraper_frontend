# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode in 3001 port.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

In this project, I added two pages:

1. Listing the products in the root directory (/).
2. Adding a new product by pasting the URL, which will scrape the data from the e-commerce website. Please check after some time, It will display the products there.
